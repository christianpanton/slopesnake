Slope and snake algorithms
==========================

This repository contains the code used for my Annals of Glaciology article "Automated mapping of local layer slope and tracing of internal layers in radio echograms".

It contains two base directories
* slope (*for computing the local layer slope*)
* snake (*for tracing layers*)

The code is written in Python 2.x and the following libraries are needed (see also requirements.txt)
* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib

I will try to maintain the repository https://github.com/christianpanton/slopesnake as well.
Please let me know of any bugs you find.
